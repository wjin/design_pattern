# Object Oriented Programming

## Basic Concept

* Abstraction

* Encapsulation

* Polymorphism

* Inheritance

## Principle

Encapsulate what varies

Favor composition over inheritance

Program to interface not an implementation

Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact (observer)

Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification (decorator)

Depend on abstraction. Do not depend on concrete classes (factory method: dependency
Inversion Principle)
 
Only talk to your friends (facade)

Don’t call me. We’ll call you (template method: Hollywood principle)

A class should have only one reason to change
